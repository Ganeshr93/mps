The Remote Provisioning Service is a Node.js-based microservice that works with the Remote Provisioning Client (RPC) to activate Intel&reg; AMT platforms using a pre-defined profile.

The image below illustrates how RPS activates an Intel&reg; AMT device for remote management. In this section, we will see how to deploy number two, RPS.

### Clone the Repository

1\. Open a new Command Prompt or a Terminal. The MPS server will continue to run in your previous Command Prompt or Terminal.

2\. Clone the RPS repository to the same parent directory where the mps directory is located. Enter the following command:

```
git clone --branch ActivEdge https://github.com/open-amt-cloud-toolkit/rps.git
cd rps
```

The parent directory structure should look like this:
    
```
ðŸ“¦parent
 â”£ ðŸ“‚mps
 â”— ðŸ“‚rps
```


### Start the RPS Server

1\. In the rps directory, run the install command to install all required dependencies. 

```
npm install
```

2\. Then, start the server. By default, the RPS web port is 8080.

```
npm run dev
```

>**Note:** Warning messages are okay and expected for optional dependencies.
